            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True ACCOUNT OF THE Lord Delamere HIS <hi>Reception and Wellcome</hi> IN CHESHIRE, And at the City of Cheſter.</head>
            <p>OUR <hi>Engliſh Barons</hi> have ever made a great Name in Hiſtory; their Power and Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and the <hi>Barons Wars,</hi> are never to be forgotten; though at this time the Face of Affairs and Government with us is ſo Modelled and Altered, that little remains of that their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Greatneſs, ſave what we read of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member from <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi> of former Days. Only for an Inſtance of that kind, we may reckon the late Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> who ſhewed,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42359:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 47 -->before the <hi>Reſtauration,</hi> what Influence and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity an Ancient Family (which had always treated his Neighbours and Country with an unfeigned Heart and Tenderneſs) might have over them.</p>
            <p>Nor upon the King's <hi>Reſtauration</hi> did the Title of <hi>Delamere</hi> alter the Conditions betwixt them; the Name of Lord made no Stranger on either ſide. Upon his Death, the preſent Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> found come upon him the New Title, but without any Acceſſion to the Old Eſtate. He had the ſame Hearty Affection to his Country, and actually ſucceeded to that Hereditary Vertue of the Family. Nor have his Country-men been leſs ready, on their part, to expreſs on all Occaſions the Eſteem and due Senſe they had of his Love and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for them. This good Underſtanding and Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence upon any Extraordinary Conjuncture, carried the Eyes of the Nation upon my Lord <hi>Delamere.</hi> And the People became poſſeſſed with a Conceit, that <hi>England</hi> could not be reſcued from their Oppreſſions, <hi>England</hi> could not be Saved, unleſs my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> had an Hand in their Deliverance.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, when <hi>Monmouth</hi> precipitated Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and threw himſelf on that ill-concerted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Expedition at <hi>Lyme,</hi> every one had their Eyes upon my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> every one ſuſpended their Thoughts, and were upon the Expectation which way my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> would ſtir, and whether he would appear or not.</p>
            <p>This deference of all People to my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> ſo alarmed the Court, that after <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Defeat, they reſolved to be no longer under thoſe Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42359:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 47 -->from my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> but by one Law-trick or other, to diſpatch him out of the way. So they ſet their Inſtruments to work, and rummaged all their Magazines of Falſe Evidence to play againſt him. How his Wit, and Conduct, and Bravery of Mind brought him off, and baffled his Enemies, is to the World well known already. This provoked him to retire to his Country Friends and Enjoyments, there to cultivate the Popularity he had ſo ancient and ſo good a Title to.</p>
            <p>There we find him, when the Nation all over rung with an Invaſion by the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> a Deſign that then ſeem'd too great to be believed, and only too good to be true. But we had not long been convinced by the Fact, before our Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Prints were full of my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> his Tenants and Friends, and their Rendezvouz at <hi>Bowden-Downs.</hi> His March and Motions were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently concerted with the Prince; and according to the Meaſures then taken, he joyned the Prince afterwards; and had the Honour and Satisfaction to wait on him to <hi>London,</hi> and there ſee him poſſeſſed of the Seat of our Empire, and of the Supream Adminiſtration of Affairs <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having ſucceeded, and all ſettled to his Mind, he returned to his Country, where his Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come was ſo Extraordinary, the Expreſſions from all ſorts of People, and the Joy ſo Immoderate, that the like has not been obſerved in any Age.</p>
            <p>He went down at the Head of thoſe Gentlemen he had formerly Muſter'd at <hi>Bowden-Downs.</hi> And no ſooner had he entered into his County of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> but he was met by Foot and Horſe, from that and the adjacent Counties, incredible Numbers. The
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42359:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 48 -->modeſteſt Account makes the Horſe upward of Ten Thouſand. Theſe all divided, and made a Lane for him as he paſſed along, they throwing up their Hats, with loud Acclamations and Shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>We have him again, we have him again, we have him again ſafe.</hi> Whilſt the Trumpets and the Vollies from their Guns, made up the <hi>Chorus</hi> to their Mirth and Harmony.</p>
            <p>When he came to the <hi>Downs</hi> he Muſter'd his Troops, and ordered them to their ſeveral Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. He took the Officers to his Houſe at <hi>Dunham,</hi> where they and the other Gentlemen of the <hi>County</hi> that could ſtay conveniently, Sup'd together. Two or three days after, his Occaſions called him to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and that <hi>City</hi> would not be ſhort in their Complements and Congratulation. About a Mile from the Town, their <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> met him in their <hi>Scarlet Robes</hi> and <hi>Formalities,</hi> and gave him their Hearty Thanks for the Care and Fatigue he had undergone for the ſake of his <hi>Country,</hi> their <hi>Liberties,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> When they came back to the firſt Gate, beſides the <hi>Bells</hi> and the <hi>Boonfires,</hi> all the <hi>Guns</hi> from the <hi>Caſtle</hi> proclaimed his Wellcome. He was carried to the Town-Chamber, where a Noble Banquet was provided for his Entertainment; and when his and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Health came to be Drank, the Guns from the Caſtle were again all Diſcharged.</p>
            <p>More Particulars would be needleſs. In ſhort, there be ſtill <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> who deſerve well of their Country; and People who have a due Senſe where they find that Vertue.</p>
